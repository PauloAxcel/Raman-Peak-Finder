# Raman-Peak-Finder
label saliva Raman peaks

To-Do List:

As discussed today, I am uploading the list of tasks that we will be doing. Overall I will be dealing with the main tasks, and I will give you some easy bits, so you do not get overwhelmed with new information. Depending on how you deal with the tasks I will increase the load of work :)
This file will be continuously updated with new tasks, and you can also propose new ideas. Happy to hear new stuff :)

[] Convert saliva peaks into a .csv table.

  [] Decide what content on the file we want to use, i.e. the columns should be 'bonds', 'centre' and anything else?
  
	[] ...
  
[] Update the User Interface (UI) with:

  [] File selection a posteriori
  
  [] Fix bugs related to the stacked plot
    
		[] ...
    
  [] Fix bugs related to waterfall plot
    
		[] ...
    
  [] Fix bugs related to heatmap plots
    
		[] ...
    
  [] Add PCA options
	
    [] Add on the designer app the space for PCA with:
		
      [] the desired option values for users to select
			
      [] By default should be the 'usual' values used
      
  [] Add peak finder section
	
    [] Add a section to select which peak libraries we want to use.
		
    [] Related to the already existing file, update it over on the UI, mix the two different python files into one.
		
    [] initially identify peaks by proximity to tabulated values, but for future come up a more efficient selection method.
		
    [] come up with a full-proof method for differentiating a peak from noise.
		
    [] Maybe come up with an automated multi-peak Lorentzian fit.
